We were assigned the task to solve the Falkner-Skan equation (a third order bound-
ary value problem) by converting it from a boundary value problem to an initial
value problem through the shooting method. In order to solve the initial value
ODE problem we use popular numerical methods such as Euler integration, Midpoint integration
and the 4th order Runge-Kutta method. We work on C++ and for foul display check Project1.pdf.
